#### This is the original repository for Job-Pro-5000, the majority of my commit history is here.  I created a new git repo while I was deploying to heroku, as I was having issues with the remote postgresql database.  I ended up making a number of small changes to the 'clean' repository, so I just kept it.  A full writeup is available at the link below.
## [Please see my github wiki for this web app in it's final version!](https://github.com/nmerris/Job-Pro-5K/wiki)
#### [Or go straight to the final version of this app live on Heroku](https://job-pro-5000.herokuapp.com/)

_Please note that Heroku can sometimes have an exceedingly slow response time at first, so if the welcome page doesn't load on the first try, it should on the second try.  After it 'wakes up' the pages should respond well._
